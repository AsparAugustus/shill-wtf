Functions

    balanceOf
        Description: Returns the number of tokens owned by a specific address.
        Inputs:
            owner: The address of the token owner.
        Outputs:
            The number of tokens (uint256) owned by the provided address.
        State: Read-only (view).

    Example:

    solidity

function balanceOf(address owner) public view returns (uint256)

tokenDesc

    Description: Returns the description of a token by its ID.
    Inputs:
        tokenId: The ID of the token.
    Outputs:
        The description (string) of the token.
    State: Read-only (view).

Example:

solidity

function tokenDesc(uint256 tokenId) public view returns (string)

tokenOfOwnerByIndex

    Description: Returns the token ID at a given index of the tokens list of the requested owner.
    Inputs:
        owner: The address of the token owner.
        index: The index of the token in the owner's list of tokens.
    Outputs:
        The token ID (uint256) owned by the provided address at the specified index.
    State: Read-only (view).

Example:

solidity

    function tokenOfOwnerByIndex(address owner, uint256 index) public view returns (uint256)

Summary

    balanceOf(address owner): Returns the total number of tokens owned by the specified address.
    tokenDesc(uint256 tokenId): Returns the description of the specified token by its ID.
    tokenOfOwnerByIndex(address owner, uint256 index): Returns the token ID at the given index for the specified owner's token list.

These functions are typical in an NFT (Non-Fungible Token) contract, allowing users to query the number of tokens an address owns, retrieve the description of a specific token, and get the token ID by index for an owner's tokens.
